Game of Life
===

Game of life simulator, written in Java 8 as a JavaFX project. Click on a cell to toggle it's life/death, play to run the simulation, pause to pause it, seed to seed the board with a random configuration, and clear to clear the board. The board is a toroidal grid, so it wraps around. You can save/load configurations, as well.
